          h2.text-center Hello there!
          p My name is Abhinav Mishra and I am running to be your DoCSoc President. I am a second year computing student here at Imperial and the current Education Officer for DoCSoc. This year, I have helped organise most of the events, from the Sponsors Exhibition and industrial talks to IC Hack and the recent series of Web Dev Workshops. I believe that the various roles I had this year have molded me into a person, fit to lead the most happening society on campus.
          p If elected, my top priorities would be to
          ul(style="display: list-item; list-style-type:circle")
            li - Involve EIE students and Postgraduates as much as possible and make sure that their voices are heard.
            li - Improve and expand IC Hack. We are the largest student run hackathon in London but I want it to be the largest in the UK.
            li - Setup basic support services for students facing problems in the Department.
            li - Run a series of workshops on Interviews and Coding Challenges, early in the recruitment cycle for maximum benefit.
            li - Strengthen relations with the Union, Department and other societies on campus.
            li - Improve catering for all the events, basically more food and drinks.
            li - Sign more sponsors and have more engaging and large-scale industrial events.
            li - Have pre-approved funding from the Union for big events so that committee members don't end up paying from their pockets and waiting for weeks to get it back.
            li - Improve the common room and the tea point and have a regular supply of food for everyone.
